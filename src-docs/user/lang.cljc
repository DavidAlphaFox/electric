  "reactive interop with clojure dynamic scope"
  ; motivating use case: (defnode hf-nav [kf e] (kf (d/entity *db* e)))
  ; we think this is well defined but dangerous because
  ; each and every down-scope function call will react on this implicit global
  ; which can be catastrophic to performance
  (def ^:dynamic *db*)
  ; all reactive bindings are captured and attached to both of these calls
  ; only reactive bindings must be translated, not clojure bindings
  (defn not-query [] (inc 1))                               ; reacts on implicit global !!
