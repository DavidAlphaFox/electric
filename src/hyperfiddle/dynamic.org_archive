  left to right direction
  actor User
  package AuthenticationService {
          usecase "Sign in" as SI
          usecase FP as "
          Forgot password
          --
          - email
          "
          usecase "Logout" as L
          usecase Creds as "
          Provide Credentials
          --
          - email
          - password
          "
          usecase InitialCreds as "
          Confirm Credentials
          --
          - confirm password
          - validate email
          "
          SI ..> Creds : includes
