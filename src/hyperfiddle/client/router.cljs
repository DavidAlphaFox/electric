;;; Beware!
;;; Pushy internally creates a `goog.History` instance, which has many drawbacks.
;;; Please read the doc here https://google.github.io/closure-library/api/goog.History.html
;;; and make sure you understand this sentence:
;;; > This object should be created from a script in the document body before the
;;; > document has finished loading.
;;; It's normal and expected for this namespace to not play well with live reloading.
;;; If you want to make sure its state is in sync with the code, just hit refresh.
