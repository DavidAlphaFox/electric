; first way (do a b) is same as (let [_ a] b) - true in clojure. Problem here is do stmts (a) are never sampled which is
; never what you want
;
; second way (do a b) is the same as (case a b). a and b are sequenced. problem is b is not constructed until a is
; available (maybe bug). This is what we have today, may not disqualify the current behavior
;
; third way (do a b) is same as ({} a b); both are constructed at the same time and we need both to be available for the
; do expression to be available. whenever a changes, the expr changes.

; if we really want to be able to close over reactive values we
; need to solve the problem of dynamic extent. if a node closes over a
; reactive value and this value is destroyed due to a conditional switching,
; what happens ?
; In other words, there is a dag alive that needs X and X dies
; Should that dag be killed as well, or allowed to live with last known value of x, or undefined?
