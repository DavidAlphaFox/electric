                # 1 — Counter

                Challenge: Understanding the basic ideas of a language/toolkit.

                ![](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/static/counter.9cd92091.png)

                The task is to build a frame containing a label or read-only textfield T and
                a button B. Initially, the value in T is “0” and each click of B increases
                the value in T by one.

                Counter serves as a gentle introduction to the basics of the language,
                paradigm and toolkit for one of the simplest GUI applications imaginable.
                Thus, Counter reveals the required scaffolding and how the very basic
                features work together to build a GUI application. A good solution will have
                almost no scaffolding.

                # 2 — Temperature Converter

                Challenges: bidirectional data flow, user-provided text input.

                ![](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/static/tempconv.de9aff1f.png)


                The task is to build a frame containing two textfields TC and TF representing
                the temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit, respectively. Initially, both TC
                and TF are empty. When the user enters a numerical value into TC the
                corresponding value in TF is automatically updated and vice versa. When the
                user enters a non-numerical string into TC the value in TF is not updated and
                vice versa. The formula for converting a temperature C in Celsius into a
                temperature F in Fahrenheit is `C = (F - 32) * (5/9)` and the dual direction is
                `F = C * (9/5) + 32`.

                Temperature Converter increases the complexity of Counter by having
                bidirectional data flow between the Celsius and Fahrenheit inputs and the
                need to check the user input for validity. A good solution will make the
                bidirectional dependency very clear with minimal boilerplate code.

                Temperature Converter is inspired by the Celsius/Fahrenheit converter from
                the book Programming in Scala. It is such a widespread example—sometimes also
                in the form of a currency converter—that one could give a thousand
                references. The same is true for the Counter task.

                # 3 — Flight Booker

                Challenge: Constraints.

                ![](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/static/bookflight.a5434663.png)


                The focus of Flight Booker lies on modelling constraints between widgets on
                the one hand and modelling constraints within a widget on the other hand.
                Such constraints are very common in everyday interactions with GUI
                applications. A good solution for Flight Booker will make the constraints
                clear, succinct and explicit in the source code and not hidden behind a lot
                of scaffolding.

                The task is:

                - [x] to build a frame containing a combobox C with the two options “one-way
                flight” and “return flight”,
                - [x] two textfields T1 and T2 representing the start and return date,
                respectively,
                - [x] and a button B for submitting the selected flight.
                - [x] T2 is enabled iff C’s value is “return flight”.
                - [x] When C has the value “return flight” and T2’s date is strictly before
                T1’s then B is disabled.
                - [x] When a non-disabled textfield T has an ill-formatted date then T is
                colored red and B is disabled.
                - [x] When clicking B a message is displayed informing the user of his
                selection (e.g. “You have booked a one-way flight on 04.04.2014.”).
                - [x] Initially, C has the value “one-way flight”
                - [x] and T1 as well as T2 have the same (arbitrary) date
                - [x] (it is implied that T2 is disabled).

                # 4 — Timer

                Challenges: concurrency, competing user/signal interactions, responsiveness.

                ![](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/static/timer.ed46b6b4.png)

                The task is to build a frame containing a gauge `G` for the elapsed time `e`,
                a label which shows the elapsed time as a numerical value, a slider `S` by
                which the duration `d` of the timer can be adjusted while the timer is running
                and a reset button `R`.

                - [x] Adjusting `S` must immediately reflect on `d` and not only when `S` is
                released.
                - [x] It follows that while moving `S` the filled amount of `G` will (usually)
                change immediately.
                - [x] When `e ≥ d` is true then the timer stops (and `G` will be full).
                - [x] If, thereafter, `d` is increased such that `d > e` will be true then the
                timer restarts to tick until `e ≥ d` is true again.
                - [x] Clicking R will reset `e` to zero.

                # 5 — CRUD

                ![](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/static/crud.515ce94b.png)

                The task is to build a frame containing the following elements: a textfield Tprefix, a pair of textfields Tname and Tsurname, a listbox L, buttons BC, BU and BD and the three labels as seen in the screenshot. L presents a view of the data in the database that consists of a list of names. At most one entry can be selected in L at a time. By entering a string into Tprefix the user can filter the names whose surname start with the entered prefix—this should happen immediately without having to submit the prefix with enter. Clicking BC will append the resulting name from concatenating the strings in Tname and Tsurname to L. BU and BD are enabled iff an entry in L is selected. In contrast to BC, BU will not append the resulting name but instead replace the selected entry with the new name. BD will remove the selected entry. The layout is to be done like suggested in the screenshot. In particular, L must occupy all the remaining space.
